password shouldnt be allowed white spaces
QUIT cmd does nothing:
	can be fixed by making disconnectClient from Server public and using in quit cmd function, but
	causes new issue of some invalid read in valgrind. need to look into it further
file transfer needs to be tested
test max memory
leak on failed bind (and probably other errors)
irssi issues
