password shouldnt be allowed white spaces
QUIT cmd does nothing:
	can be fixed by making disconnectClient from Server public and using in quit cmd function, but
	causes new issue of some invalid read in valgrind. need to look into it further
file transfer needs to be tested
test max memory
leak on failed bind (and probably other errors) /fixed maybe
irssi issues biiig big bad
one word privmsg
	fix parameter splitting for privmsg ONLY!!!
check buffer etc
\r\n ? getnextcmd

q&a
what even poll
is pollfd vector containing copies of the one socket ready to be listening or like multiple like different sockets
why revents and operator pollin
why check after pollhup pollerr if original socket. is possible for main socket to have revents flags bad?
cleanuppollfds
colon beginning cmd

notes
max prvmsg sned char limit 4096 (4 x 1024)
