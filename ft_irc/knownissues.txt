QUIT cmd does nothing:
	can be fixed by making disconnectClient from Server public and using in quit cmd function, but
	causes new issue of some invalid read in valgrind. need to look into it further
		actually it might be fine idk.
file transfer needs to be tested
test max memory
one word privmsg
	fix parameter splitting for privmsg ONLY!!!
		wait maybe not
check buffer etc
\r\n ? getnextcmd
	maybe necessary ackshually
irssi inputs a join and mode on startup?
test max clients

q&a
what even poll
is pollfd vector containing copies of the one socket ready to be listening or like multiple like different sockets
why revents and operator pollin
why check after pollhup pollerr if original socket. is possible for main socket to have revents flags bad?
cleanuppollfds
colon beginning cmd

notes
max prvmsg sned char limit 4096 (4 x 1024)
